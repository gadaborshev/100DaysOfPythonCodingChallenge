# Exercise 1. Heads or tails.

You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

There are many ways of doing this. But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.

e.g. 1 means Heads 0 means Tails

Example Output
Heads
or
Tails

# Exercise 2  Banker roulette.

You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as names followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

Example Input
Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.

Example Output
Michael is going to buy the meal today!
Hint
You might need the help of the len() function.

Remember that Lists start at index 0!
