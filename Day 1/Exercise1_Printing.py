<!-- Instructions
Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function.

Warning: The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.

Example Output
After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:
![Alt text](ex1_1-1.png)
Day 1 - Python Print Function
The function is declared like this:
print('what to print')
e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:
![Alt text](<ex 1 _2-1.gif>) -->

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")
